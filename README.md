# Odin Recipes
This project will show my capabilities in the HTML language through the appropiate  
use of absolute, relative links, and tags (specifically ordered, unordered lists, and link tags).  
Additionally, this project helped me develop my understanding of Git as a version
control and how to use it effectively.
